Pebble.js code from HackPR2015
    An ATH movil client for pebble. When finished would let you send money to your contacts that also have ath movil
    developed by:
      -Alejandro Salvador Vega Nogales
      -Israel Dilan
      -Omar Cruz
      -Jos√© Montero

    -Issues:
      - code is not very organized/commented
      - using phony users. need to implement a way to sign in/register (probably from phone)
      - UI is not very well implemented. didn't manage to figure out how to call menus from another menu. (need to
        rewrite the hierarchy of our UI elements??)
      - Using options of x money amount to send. this could still be viable as ATH movil currently has no service             charge
      - needs a way to check if the contact you choose to send money to has a an ath movil account
      - a rewrite to C with a JS plugin could be considered (a lot of work) for better performance
