Pebble.js code from HackPR2015

    -An ATH movil client for pebble. When finished would let you send money to your contacts that also have ath movil
    developed by:
      -Alejandro Salvador Vega Nogales
      -Israel O. Dilan Pantojas
      -Omar Cruz Pantoja
      -Jos√© Montero

    -Issues:
	- Code organization can be improved and better commented.
	- Using "Hard Coded phony users", need to implement a way to sign in/register. (probably from phone)
	- UI can be improved.
	- Using preset amounts to send, would like to implement an acumulator, but this could still be viable as ATH movil currently has no service charge.
	- Needs a way to check if the contact you choose to send money to has a an ath movil account.
	- At the moment all API calls are commented. Need help parsing JSON and implementing API calls.
	- A rewrite to C with a JS plugin could be considered (a lot of work) for better performance.
