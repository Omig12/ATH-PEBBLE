Pebble.js code from HackPR2015

    -An ATH movil client for pebble. When finished would let you send money to your contacts that also have ath movil
    developed by:
      -Alejandro Salvador Vega Nogales
      -Israel O. Dilan Pantojas
      -Omar Cruz Pantoja
      -Jos√© Montero

    -Issues:
	- Code is not well organized/commented.
	- Using "Hard Coded phony users", need to implement a way to sign in/register. (probably from phone)
	- UI is not very well implemented. Didn't manage to figure out how to call menus from another menu.
(Probably need to rewrite the hierarchy of our UI elements??)
	- Using options of x money amount to send. This could still be viable as ATH movil currently has no service charge.
	- Needs a way to check if the contact you choose to send money to has a an ath movil account.
	- A rewrite to C with a JS plugin could be considered (a lot of work) for better performance.
